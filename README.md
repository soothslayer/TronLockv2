[In Progress] iOS SDK for Lockitron

This is a simlified version of Sebastien's Lockitron SDK in that it doesn't have any podfile dependences. This means I had to write my own authenticator tool and manually coded JSON decoding. 

Also during the development of this I upgraded from using version 1 of Lockitron's API to version 2 (you'll still see remanats of v1 in there but it's been deprecated in favor of v2.

I also added a lock details page and am in the process of futher developing the UI and adding push notifications on lock and unlock.
